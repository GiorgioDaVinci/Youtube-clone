# Youtube-clone

## Description

I decided to take on the challenge to try recreate the youtube.com webpage following the html-css-course from the YouTube channel, supersimpledev. This was done to facilitate my learning in front-end-web development.

I was able to apply all the concepts learnt in css such as positioning, display, etc. 
Also, within html I was able to apply appropriate classes.
